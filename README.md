# Book-translator
possibly the best program I have written to date: A program to translate images by selection, like google lens but more accurate

run the GUIs, or test.py not main/main-unstable.

GUI = stable, outputs in console
GUI2 = unstable, allows for multiple selections, outputs in console.
test = unstable, allows for multilple selections, and outputs on the selected area.

Requires a temp folder in same directory called 'temp'
